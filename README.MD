# K6.IO  
## Load Testing Tool  

This project contains a small set of endpoints from the free NASA API. Check it out [here](https://api.nasa.gov/).  

The examples of load scripts in the repository allow you to test the API's capability to handle system load.  

Additionally, after running the scripts, you can generate an HTML report with the results of the performance tests.  

### Commands  

```sh
npm run {script-name}  
# Example: npm run load:get_planet
